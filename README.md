Personal Health Record based in Indivo server

Indivo is the original personally controlled health record (PCHR) system. A PCHR enables an individual to own and manage a complete, secure, digital copy of her health and wellness information. Indivo integrates health information across sites of care and over time. Indivo is free and open-source, uses open, unencumbered standards, and is actively deployed in diverse settings, in particular our own Children's Hospital Boston and the Dossia Consortium. The original Indivo server is located at https://github.com/chb/indivo_server. Indivo documentation is located at http://docs.indivohealth.org/en/2.0/.

I used Indivo estensively for developing doctor / patient facing front end apps. Inidvo technology is dated and there has been no enhancements / upgrades to it since the past 8 years. I am developing a new PHR using the latest Django and python with much simpler use cases bit taking ideas from Indivo.

This is work in progress and I will update this repo as I bring this to a logical release version.
